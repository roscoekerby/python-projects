# Podcast Episode Scraper

This project is a web scraping tool that automates the extraction of podcast episode information (titles, descriptions, and URLs) from a specified Apple Podcasts page. Using `Selenium` and `webdriver_manager`, this scraper navigates through a podcast's episode list, retrieves key details, and outputs them in a structured format.

## Features

- **Scrapes Podcast Episode Details**: Extracts episode titles, descriptions, and URLs from a specified Apple Podcasts page.
- **Scrolling to Load All Episodes**: Automatically scrolls to the bottom of the page to load all episodes, ensuring all content is captured.
- **Order Toggle**: Allows toggling between ordering episodes from **Earliest** to **Latest** or vice versa.
- **Headless Mode**: Runs in headless mode to allow for server or background operation without a graphical interface.

## Future Work

- **YouTube URL Integration**: Add functionality to extract and display corresponding YouTube URLs (if available) for each episode.
- **Improved Ordering Mechanism**: Expand the order toggle feature to sort episodes based on other criteria, such as **Popularity** or **Duration**.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement retry mechanisms and detailed error logs for improved resilience on network or page load errors.
- **Multithreading Support**: Allow for parallel scraping of multiple podcast pages to speed up the scraping process.
- **Data Storage Options**: Save scraped data to formats like CSV, JSON, or database for easier data analysis and manipulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python** (version 3.7+)
- **Google Chrome** (ensure it’s up-to-date)
- **ChromeDriver** (managed automatically with `webdriver_manager`)

### Required Packages

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install selenium webdriver-manager
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/podcast-episode-scraper.git
   cd podcast-episode-scraper
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

If you need to change the scraping URL or adjust settings like scrolling time, update the relevant variables in the script.

## Usage

To run the scraper:

1. **Specify the Podcast URL**:
   Set the URL of the podcast's episode list page in the `url` variable in the script:
   
   ```python
   url = "https://podcasts.apple.com/za/podcast/the-muscle-growth-podcast/id1717906577/episodes"
   ```

2. **Execute the Script**:
   
   ```bash
   python podcast_scraper.py
   ```

3. **Choose Ordering**:
   Set the `order_toggle` variable to `Earliest` or `Latest` to determine the order in which episodes are scraped.

   ```python
   order_toggle = "Earliest"  # or "Latest"
   ```

4. **Output**:
   The script will print each episode's details to the console and display the total number of episodes scraped at the end.

## Troubleshooting

- **Webdriver Errors**: Ensure `webdriver_manager` is installed and Chrome is up-to-date. You can update ChromeDriver automatically by using the provided configuration.
- **Timeout Errors**: Try increasing the `SCROLL_PAUSE_TIME` or adjusting `WebDriverWait` values if episodes aren’t loading fully.
